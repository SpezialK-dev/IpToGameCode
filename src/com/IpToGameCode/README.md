# The Idea behind this projekt 

for a school projekt I needed to turn ips into gamecodes so that they could be used instead of just writing the Ip and so I thought well lets see what Ideas I can come up with.

### What I need to archive

I need to turn 4 numbers each ranging from 0 to 255 into letters and numbers that are fewer than a normal Ip address

### Possible solutions 

##### Solution 1
the letters represent incremetns of 10 that means that A = 10 , B = 20 and so on. 
numbers just represent their normal value
this would give me the exapt same resoult as using hexadecimal numbers but my version could be improved because I have more letters than needed to compleat the task so I can probaly do some trickery to make it shorter
